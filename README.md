## Oracles

Oracles are data providers to smart contracts. Consisting of smart contracts and off-chain software.

## Bridges

Bridges are the same as oracles, only the information is transferred between blockchains. There are different types of bridges and security approaches.

The `bridge` folder contains the Solidity code that implements the mechanics of a simple bridge.

In Solana, it is possible to develop a smc using both the usual approach (Solana) and the Anchor snap-in. This makes it easier to develop a smc for Solana.

The `solana-anchor` folder contains the template code explained in the video tutorial.
